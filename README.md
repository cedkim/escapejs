Let your websites escape the boundaries of the display, with anaglyphic 3d.
## Usage
Add the `escape.js` script to your webpage, and add the class `escapeJS` to all elements that should be 3D. This is all you usually need, however, you can declare a `window.escapeAutoOffset` variable (before adding `escape.js`) to adjust the auto-offset value. The default is `0.005`. If you want to declare exact offsets on an element-by-element basis, you can use the `data-escape-offset` attribute.
